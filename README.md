# VirtualCT - 20220412 version
This project provides a virtual fan CT system with an elementary information for objects.
This is composed of two basic codes,
1. material based forward projection algorithm (MBFPA),
2. Fltered back projection (FBP).
The former includes the simple beam-hardening correction algorithm as well as the signal noise model.
